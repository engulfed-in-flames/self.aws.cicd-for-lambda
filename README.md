## Setup

1. Prerequisites
   1. Create a Lambda function to be updated under this CI/CD workflow.
   2. Create a ECR registry where builded image will be pushed.
   3. Setup GitHub's repository variables which are interpolated in workflow.
2. Create a stack for GitHub's OIDC provider with the given CloudFormation template.
   Stack name example: {namespaces or product name}-{environment}-{main feature}-{sub feature}
   - pn-prod-cicd-oidc
   - ns-dev-network-api
3.

## Notes

### Creating a Lambda Function

> ![IMPORTANT]
> To create a Lambda function from a container image, build your image locally and upload it to an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository.
>
> â€” [Create a Lambda function using a container image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html)

### OIDC Provider

GitHub's OIDC provider is a service that allows GitHub Actions workflows to access resources in cloud providers without storing long-lived credentials as secrets. It uses OpenID Connect (OIDC), an authentication protocol, to securely exchange short-lived tokens between GitHub and the cloud provider.

**Advantages:**

- Enhanced security: Reduces risk of credential exposure
- Improved management: Automates credential rotation
- Flexible access control: Enables fine-grained access policies

### GitHub OIDC Thumbprint

- Thumbprint usually verifies GitHub's identity during login.
- Not used for special case of GitHub Actions to AWS login. (Like using a different security system)
- A value is still needed in configuration, even if it's just a placeholder.
